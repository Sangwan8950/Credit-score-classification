<h3 align="left">Steps</h3>
<p align="left">
⚫Performed data preprocessing.<br>
⚫Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).<br
⚫Performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations.<br>
⚫Transformed the data for analysis.<br>
⚫Selected a suitable algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).<br>
⚫Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)<br>
⚫Classify customers into categories based on the model's predictions.<br>
